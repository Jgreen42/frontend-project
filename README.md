>This project Was Easily a Rabbit Whole because there is so much different styles of art utilizing Type script. 
I was searching different ways in converting images. First Guess was I had to learn how to grab the Pixel Data.
From there I learned different ways on iterating through the pixels. I stumbled upon some methods in which I will link below including a live demonstration.
This one was exciting and I am glad to try it out, I am simplifying it for now because It can get super complicated! More so than It needs to be. It involves a ASCII Binary table think of it like a barcode for a letter or character. There is a specific method in which it converts to binary and huge amount of binary data is called a BLOB. 
be sure to follow me for upcoming projects. Also If your bored I am starting a list titled (pandoras Box) on my github handle.

# WireFrame Template 
- this was a begining rough draft of a layout for the UI Interface on the app.
- Wireframing is important for guiding your self through a project and keeping things structured.
- ERD Flow Charts, (Entity Relationship Diagram)- are imporant as well and structuring your data.
